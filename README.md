# YorkRegion-CrimeForecast

## Task 1

In this task, we aim to forecast the average number of crimes expected to occur in the upcoming 30 days. To achieve this, we use multiple features:

1. **Historical Crime Data**: The number of crimes reported in the previous 30 days.
  
2. **External Features**: Various external indicators such as temperature, precipitation levels, and unemployment rates, among others, from the last 30 days.

3. **Time Features**: Periodic time features that capture seasonality and trends in the data.

By leveraging these features, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the average number of crimes for the next 30 days.
